# JigSaw puzzle in 115 LOC

This code is part of a series of live streams I where I try to create prototypes 
in less than 100 lines of code and less than 2.5hrs of time.

It's worth noting that I don't use any third party libraries in this project but only the Elm standard libraries.

I only made it down to 115 lines of code and had to cut some pretty ugly corners.

- Check out [MainOptimized.elm](src/MainOptimized.elm) for the 115LOC version
- or for more readability [Main.elm](src/Main.elm) for the version that's formatted with Elm's code formatter 

## Usage

1. [Install elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm)
2. execute `elm reactor` in the terminal and visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
